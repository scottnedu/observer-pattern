# Telephone Package - Observer Pattern Implementation

This project demonstrates the Observer Pattern using JavaScript by implementing a Telephone Package that allows managing phone numbers and notifying observers when a number is dialed.

# Features

Add a phone number to the telephone's contact list.

Remove a phone number from the contact list.

Dial a phone number (only if it exists in the contact list).

Observer Pattern Implementation:

Observers are notified whenever a phone number is dialed.

# Two observers are added:

Prints the phone number dialed.

Prints "Now Dialling"

# I used Set Data Structure for efficient phone number storage.
